The real-time emotion recognition system using facial expressions, implemented using computing methodologies, has a lot of scope for improvement. The key areas of enhancement include model improvement, hardware optimization, data pipeline optimization, hyperparameter tuning, and exploring different models and image processing techniques. The model can be improved by increasing the dataset, which would further increase its accuracy. Optimizing the hyperparameters of the model can improve its performance. Another approach that can be adopted to increase the model is by running more epochs, which would enhance the convergence and accuracy of the predictions. By using high-resolution cameras and GPUs, we can optimize the hardware to improve the performance of the system. The data pipeline can be optimized by data and batch preprocessing techniques. To explore further, one can also dive into different model architectures, such as transfer learning using pre-trained models like VGG16 and ResNet for emotion recognition tasks.
